     * **Breaking Change (v2.3.5):** This method is now suspending to prevent deadlock risks.
     * Previously used `runBlocking` which could cause deadlocks under load.
     *
     * Migration:
     * ```kotlin
     * // Before (v2.3.x):
     * val chain = scheduler.beginWith(task).then(task2)
     * chain.enqueue()  // Blocking call
     *
     * // After (v2.3.5+):
     * val chain = scheduler.beginWith(task).then(task2)
     * chain.enqueue()  // Now suspending - call from coroutine
     * ```

     * @param chain The task chain to enqueue
     * @param id Unique identifier for the chain (optional, auto-generated if not provided)
     * @param policy How to handle if a chain with the same ID already exists
     * @since 2.3.5 Now suspending to prevent deadlock risks

    /**
     * Flush all pending progress updates to disk immediately.
     * Added in v2.3.5 to prevent data loss when your app goes to the background.
     *
     * **When to use:**
     * - iOS: Call from `applicationWillResignActive` in AppDelegate
     * - Android: Optional (WorkManager handles this automatically)
     * - Before BGTask expiration
     * - Before app termination
     *
     * **Benefits:**
     * - Guarantees no progress data is lost when iOS suspends your app
     * - Takes 10-50ms (negligible for rare suspension events)
     *
     * **Example (iOS):**
     * ```swift
     * // In AppDelegate.swift:
     * func applicationWillResignActive(_ application: UIApplication) {
     *     KmpWorkManager.shared.backgroundTaskScheduler.flushPendingProgress()
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * **Example Usage (Android):**
     * ```kotlin
     * // In critical Activity:
     * override fun onPause() {
     *     super.onPause()
     *     KmpWorkManager.getInstance().backgroundTaskScheduler.flushPendingProgress()
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * @since 2.3.4
