/**
 * Persistent storage for task completion events.
 *
 * Events are stored to survive app restarts and force-quits,
 * ensuring no event loss when UI is not actively listening.
 *
 * Implementation Strategy:
 * - Android: SQLDelight with SQLite database
 * - iOS: File-based storage (IosFileStorage) for consistency
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * 1. Worker completes task → emit to EventBus + saveEvent()
 * 2. App launches → getUnconsumedEvents() + replay to EventBus
 * 3. UI processes event → markEventConsumed()
 * 4. Periodic cleanup → clearOldEvents()
 *
 * Performance:
 * - Target: <100ms for getUnconsumedEvents()
 * - Auto-cleanup events older than 7 days
 * - Maximum 1000 events stored
